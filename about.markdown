# Hi I'm Ariana Rodriguez
I have over 5 years of experience as a developer. Throughout my career, I have worked on projects involving technologies such as Adobe Experience Manager, HTML, CSS3, JavaScript, and others. Additionally, I have experience working with Adobe PSD, Sketch, XD, Studio, Veeva Vault, and more. This diverse knowledge has provided me with the opportunity to work on newsletter development, front-end development, and interactive development.

I am passionate about continuous learning and enjoy taking on new challenges to advance my career. I am currently seeking opportunities that leverage my expertise and industry knowledge while allowing me to grow further as a Software Developer.
